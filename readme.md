about
-----

Monolith is a starter WordPress theme built with Twitter Bootstrap. We started this project as our own internal starter
theme, because most of the other theme frameworks out there either did too much or not enough for our needs. So we built our own.

Alongside the Bootstrap grid magic, monolith comes bundled with a few useful functions and shortcodes that we've found useful enough to use on most projects. Anything that is too project-specific or heavy has been stripped out, and can be easily implemented on a case by case basis.

The aim is for Monolith to be constantly growing – changing and developing as trends and web frameworks change, always giving us a good solid starting point from which to create our web projects.

Monolith is released under the MIT Open Source license, so you're welcome to use it on any free or commercial projects of your own.

Be sure to read [the documentation](https://github.com/bigspring/monolith/wiki).
